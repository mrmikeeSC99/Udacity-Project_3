for self-checking their submission.

Installation:
-------------

Copy files to your web server.

I used the simple python server for development.

`cd <project_dir>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Then open your web browser to http://localhost:8000 to start the game.

Game Play
---------

Press the up, down, left, right arrow keys on the keyboard to move your character.

AVOID running into the beatles. If one hits you, you loose.

Your goal is to make it to the top of the screen without geting hit by a beatle.
